  Alhamdulilah, with the help of Allah (SWT), I have a created a html website,
  And will be keep on working and learning to code, develop new ideas and content which should be helpful to our world,  
</p>

<p>The purpose of learing and coding, its not to change with career background,
  but learn to combine and integrate engineering disciplines, which might to help to create a product with the help of codings,
</p>

<p>And also to help and educate others from Dopamine activities like addicted to gaming or anyother stuff,
  and to create an environment which will engage them in Detoxification activities for our young generation,
   with what i have learnt,Thats it about me, Nothing much.
